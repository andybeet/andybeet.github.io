I am a research scientist and analyst (with [IBSS](https://www.ibsscorp.com/)) in support of NOAA Fisheries. I am part of the [Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB) which uses open science principles to develop and apply ecosystem and statistical models. We integrate information on biological, climate, oceanographic, and human-related activities to evaluate the effects on ecosystem structure and function.

I received an undergraduate and masters degrees in Statistics from University of Wales, Swansea. Current research interests include ecosystem based fisheries management, multispecies ecosystem modelling, understanding the biological and technical interactions within complex ecosystems. I am a proponent of open science principles aiming to increase reproducibility and transparency in collaborative team settings. 

I also hold a guest investigator position in the [Marine Policy Center](https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/understand/departments-centers-labs/mpc/) at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/).
