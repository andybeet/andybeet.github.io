Regardless of the language you are coding in, at some point, there will come a time when you just need to ask for help. When you do, you should always include a reproducible example to help explain your problem.  Failing to do so will just irritate readers and limit the number of helpful responses.

So what exactly is a reproducible example? [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) has a nice page on this.

For R users there is a wonderful package created by Jenny Bryan (one of the Rstudio folks) to make life a little easier. The package is called [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/index.html) and it is a dream to use.

So let's create a reproducible example! I was recently asked why one of the packages i developed ([buoydata](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/buoydata?tab=readme-ov-file#buoydata-)) was not returning any buoy information for a given spatial region (between latitudes [33-34] and longitudes [-120 -119]). For example

``` r
buoydata::buoyDataWorld |>
  dplyr::filter(LAT > 33,LAT < 34) |>
  dplyr::filter(LON > -119, LON < -120)
#> # A tibble: 0 × 13
#> # ℹ 13 variables: ID <chr>, Y1 <dbl>, YN <dbl>, nYEARS <dbl>, LAT <dbl>,
#> #   LON <dbl>, STATION_LOC <chr>, STATION_NAME <chr>, TTYPE <chr>,
#> #   TIMEZONE <chr>, OWNER <chr>, OWNERNAME <chr>, COUNTRYCODE <chr>
```

This chunk of R code was created using the [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/index.html) package (as is displayed under the output). Generating this is simple. All you need to do is wrap the `reprex` function (from the `reprex` package) around your code.

``` r
reprex::reprex({
  buoydata::buoyDataWorld |>
    dplyr::filter(LAT > 33,LAT < 34) |>
    dplyr::filter(LON > -119, LON < -120)
})
```

When this this bit of code is executed in R, it is rendered to the clipboard (and also to the viewer tab in RStudio). All you need to do is paste it! Whether that is in an email, on stack overflow, or as an issue on GitHub

The recipient can then see exactly what you are trying to do, the functions you are using, and the expected output. This makes it easier for anyone to help troubleshoot your problem.

For this particular example, the problem is that the LON arguments were in reverse order. Eg.

``` r
buoydata::buoyDataWorld |>
  dplyr::filter(LAT > 33,LAT < 34) |>
  dplyr::filter(LON > -120 , LON < -119)
#> # A tibble: 8 × 13
#>   ID       Y1    YN nYEARS   LAT   LON STATION_LOC   STATION_NAME TTYPE TIMEZONE
#>   <chr> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>         <chr>        <chr> <chr>
