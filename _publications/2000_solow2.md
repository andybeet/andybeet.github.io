Many biological populations exhibit both seasonal variability and interannual trend in abundance. When interest centers on the latter, economy can be gained by sampling the population in only one season each year. This note addresses the question: In which season should the population be sampled to provide the best estimate of interannual trend? The answer is shown to depend on the nature of the interannual trend.
