Traditional statistical methods for testing for differences between vertical plankton distributions are invalid if the distributions are patchy. This Note describes a statistical test for differences in vertical plankton distributions in the presence of patchiness when replicate samples are available. An illustration involving a test for day/night differences in the vertical distribution of the copepod Calanus pacificus is presented.
