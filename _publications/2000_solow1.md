Traditional statistical methods for testing for differences in vertical plankton distributions are invalid when the distributions are patchy. This note describes a modification of the Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test that is insensitive to patchiness. The modified test is applied to some data on day‐night differences in the vertical distribution of two zooplankton taxa.
