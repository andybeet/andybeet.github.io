Study of the mesoscale spatial variability of zooplankton populations was a major element in FLEX, a survey of a l00km square box in the North Sea over 100 days in the spring and early summer of 1976. There was also an excellent time series on diel vertical migration (DVM) of the copepod populations as well as current meter data at several depths collected by German colleagues. These data provide the basis for an evaluation of the effects of DVM on the mesoscale patchiness of Calanus finmarchicus in relation to horizontal advection and vertical shear operating in their environment. The processes of redistribution at these mesoscales appear to be critical to the population dynamics.
